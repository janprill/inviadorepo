      <h2>Legal basis</h2>
      <h3 id="m13">Applicable legal bases</h3>
      <p class="mt-4">
        In the following we inform you about the legal basis of the Data Protection Ordinance (DSGVO), on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions
        of the DSGVO, the national data protection regulations in your or our country of residence and domicile may also apply.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc mt-4">
        <li>
          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a DSGVO)</strong> - The data subject has given his/her consent to the processing of his/her personal data for one or more specific purposes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f. DSGVO)</strong>
            - Processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the data controller or of a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject,
            which require the protection of personal data, prevail.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>National data protection regulations in Germany</strong>: In addition to the data protection regulations of the Basic Data Protection Regulation, national regulations apply to data
        protection in Germany. In particular, this includes the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains
        special provisions on the right of information, the right of deletion, the right of objection, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and
        transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (ยง 26
        BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, execution or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the
        individual federal states may apply.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc mt-4"></ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl mt-16 font-bold" id="m27">Safety precautions</h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        We shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the statutory requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the
        nature, extent, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in
        order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Such measures shall include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to, and access to, input,
        transmission, securing and separation of data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data and responses to data threats.
        Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data
        protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>SSL encryption (https)</strong>: We use SSL encryption to protect your data transmitted via our online service. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in
        the address line of your browser.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl mt-16 font-bold" id="m25">Transmission and disclosure of personal data</h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        As part of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to other offices, companies, legally independent organisational units or persons or that it is disclosed
        to them. Recipients of this data may include, for example, payment institutions within the framework of payment transactions, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of
        services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and in particular conclude corresponding contracts or agreements with the recipients
        of your data which serve to protect your data.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl mt-16 font-bold" id="m24">Data processing in third countries</h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of services of third
        parties or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this is only done in accordance with the legal requirements.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Subject to express consent or transfer required by contract or law, we will only process or have the data processed in third countries with a recognised level of data protection, which
        includes US processors certified under the "Privacy Shield", or on the basis of special guarantees, such as a contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU
        Commission, the existence of certifications or binding internal data protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 DSGVO, information page of the EU Commission:

      <h2 class="text-xl mt-16 font-bold" id="m134">Use of cookies</h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        No cookies are used on this website (janprill.com). However, it is not excluded that third parties may use cookies. Therefore I inform you in the following section, generally about Cookies.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Cookies are text files that contain data from visited websites or domains and are stored by a browser on the user's computer. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user
        during or after his visit within an online offer. The information stored can include, for example, the language settings on a website, the login status, a shopping cart or the location where a
        video was viewed. The term "cookies" also includes other technologies that fulfil the same functions as cookies (e.g. if user information is stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also
        referred to as "user IDs").
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>The following cookie types and functions are distinguished:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc mt-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Temporary cookies (also: session cookies):</strong>
          Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed his browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Permanent Cookies:</strong>
          Permanent cookies remain stored even after the browser has been closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a
          website again. The interests of users who are used for range measurement or marketing purposes can also be stored in such a cookie.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>First-Party-Cookies:</strong>
          First-Party-Cookies are set by ourselves.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party-Cookies:</strong>: Third-Party-Cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process user information.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Necessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies:</strong>
          Cookies may be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to save logins or other user inputs or for security reasons).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Statistical, marketing and personalisation cookies:</strong>: Cookies are also generally used to measure a user's range and when a user's interests or behaviour (e.g. viewing certain
          content, using functions, etc.) are stored on individual web pages in a user profile. Such profiles are used, for example, to display content to users that corresponds to their potential
          interests. This procedure is also referred to as "tracking", i.e. tracking the potential interests of users. If we use cookies or "tracking" technologies, we will inform you separately in
          our privacy policy or in the context of obtaining consent.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Information on legal bases: </strong>
        The legal basis on which we process your personal data with the aid of cookies depends on whether we ask you for your consent. If this applies and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal
        basis for processing your data is your declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business
        operation of our online service and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>General information on revocation and objection (opt-out): </strong>
        Depending on whether processing is carried out on the basis of consent or legal permission, you have the possibility at any time to revoke a consent given or to object to the processing of
        your data using cookie technologies (collectively referred to as "opt-out"). You can first explain your objection using the settings of your browser, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies
        (which may also restrict the functionality of our online service). An objection to the use of cookies for the purposes of online marketing can also be explained by means of a variety of
        services, above all in the case of tracking, via the websites
        <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info" target="_blank">http://optout.aboutads.info</a>
        and

        In addition, you may receive further objection notices within the scope of the information on the service providers used and cookies.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Processing of cookie data on the basis of consent</strong>: Before we process or have processed data in the context of the use of cookies, we ask the user for a consent that can be
        revoked at any time. Before the consent has not been given, we may use cookies that are necessary for the operation of our online service. Their use is based on our interest and the user's
        interest in the expected functionality of our online service.

      <h2 class="text-xl mt-16 font-bold" id="m225">Provision of online services and web hosting</h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        In order to provide our online services securely and efficiently, we use the services of one or more web hosting providers from whose servers (or servers they manage) the online services can
        be accessed. For these purposes, we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database services, as well as security and technical maintenance
        services.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The data processed within the framework of the provision of the hosting service may include all information relating to the users of our online service that is collected within the scope of
        use and communication. This regularly includes the IP address, which is necessary in order to be able to deliver the contents of online offers to browsers, and all entries made within our
        online offer or from websites.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Collection of access data and log files</strong>: We (or our web hosting provider) collect data on each access to the server (so-called server log files). Server log files can include
        the address and name of the websites and files accessed, the date and time of access, the amount of data transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's
        operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g. to avoid overloading the server (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and to ensure server
        utilization and stability.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Content-Delivery-Network</strong>: We use a "Content-Delivery-Network" (CDN). A CDN is a service with the help of which the contents of an online offer, in particular large media files
        such as graphics or program scripts, can be delivered faster and more securely with the help of regionally distributed servers connected via the Internet.

      <p class="mt-4">
        We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications (hereinafter referred to as "newsletters") only with the consent of the recipient or a legal permission. If the contents of the
        newsletter are specifically described within the scope of registration, they are decisive for the consent of the user. In addition, our newsletters contain information about our services and
        us.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        In order to subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally sufficient for you to enter your e-mail address. However, we may ask you to provide a name for the purpose of addressing us personally
        in the newsletter, or other information, if this is required for the purposes of the newsletter.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Double opt-in procedure:</strong>
        The registration to our newsletter takes place in principle in a so-called Double-Opt-In procedure. This means that you will receive an e-mail after registration asking you to confirm your
        registration. This confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with external e-mail addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the
        registration process according to the legal requirements. This includes the storage of the registration and confirmation time as well as the IP address. Likewise the changes of your data
        stored with the Versanddienstleister are logged.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Deletion and limitation of processing: </strong>
        Deletion and limitation of processing: We may store the deleted e-mail addresses for up to three years on the basis of our legitimate interests before we delete them in order to be able to
        prove a previously given consent. The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defence against claims. An individual request for deletion is possible at any time,
        provided that the former existence of a consent is confirmed at the same time. In the case of obligations to permanently observe contradictions, we reserve the right to store the e-mail
        address solely for this purpose in a blacklist.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The logging of the registration procedure takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purposes of proving its proper course. If we commission a service provider to send
        e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure dispatch system..
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Information on legal bases:</strong>
        The newsletter is sent on the basis of the recipient's consent or, if consent is not required, on the basis of our legitimate interests in direct marketing, provided and to the extent that
        this is permitted by law, e.g. in the case of existing customer advertising. If we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests. The
        registration process is recorded on the basis of our legitimate interests to prove that it was conducted in accordance with the law.

        <strong>Performance measurement</strong>: The newsletters contain a so-called "web beacon", i.e. a file the size of a pixel, which is retrieved from our server or, if we use a dispatch service
        provider, from its server when the newsletter is opened. In the course of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP
        address and the time of retrieval, are first collected.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        This information is used for the technical improvement of our newsletter on the basis of technical data or target groups and their reading behaviour on the basis of their retrieval locations
        (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or access times. This analysis also includes determining whether newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are
        clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our endeavour nor, if used, that of the dispatch service
        provider to observe individual users. Rather, the evaluations serve us to recognise the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to
        the interests of our users.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The evaluation of the newsletter and the performance measurement are carried out, subject to the express consent of the users, on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purposes of
        using a user-friendly and secure newsletter system, which serves both our business interests and the expectations of the users.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        A separate revocation of the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in which case the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled or contradicted.

        <strong>Prerequisite for the use of free services</strong>: Consent to the sending of mailings can be made dependent on the use of free services (e.g. access to certain content or
        participation in certain campaigns) as a prerequisite. If users wish to make use of the free service without registering for the newsletter, please contact us.

      <h2 class="text-xl mt-16 font-bold" id="m12">Deletion of data</h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions as soon as their consent permitted for processing is revoked or other permissions lapse (e.g. if the
        purpose of processing this data has lapsed or it is not necessary for the purpose).
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        If the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing will be limited to these purposes. This means that the data will be blocked
        and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be stored for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal
        claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Further information on the deletion of personal data can also be found in the individual data protection notices of this data protection declaration.
