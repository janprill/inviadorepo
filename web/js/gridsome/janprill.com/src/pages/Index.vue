              Two things have to be distinguished: You can work in a certain position, on a certain level. And you can stand in this position at a certain position in the salary range. At the top or bottom. As a junior developer you can earn significantly less than your colleague at the same level, or significantly more. You get step by step action plans from me how to improve your salary so that you stay at the top of the range. And while you're doing that, you're also preparing to advance to the next level.
