                Without nagging, with the pure conscience of a person who gives his best, I build within a team, or alone Minimum Viable Products, start your eCommerce, or am your kick starter in the

                Occasionally when an internal team is no longer properly motivated, it needs an impulse from outside. I love being that impulse. I build up islands of
                good behavior and before your team realizes it's working at full power again.

            </h2>
            <p class="mt-4">
              I value crystal clear communication. I have no problem demanding from other people what I myself am willing to give: The best performance I can get and the willingness to learn at all
              times. In this way I encourage the desire to perform and maintain it until the goal is reached. In order to then directly strive for the next success.

                I take the time to find out what really moves your company and your customers and find the problems as well as the opportunities. Then I go straight to work. You will be amazed at how
                quickly I anticipate what is important, ask the right questions and how quickly success is achieved.

              I have the expertise of the IT specialist in retail. In the field of Digital Asset Management (DAM), Product Information Management (PIM) and Master Data Management (MDM) (including GS1
              and GDSN) you will hardly find more profound know-how than with me. From many years of experience as development manager of an integrator for Digital Asset Management, I am particularly

            <div>
              I speak their language, not just as a hollow catch phrase, but from real, practical, sometimes hard acquired experience. The best developers notice that. I get trusted faster than the
              best recruiter. And you know how valuable that trust is. I build up entire teams, whether in-house, remote or freelance. I have the network and the ability to build and empower entire
              integrated teams in your company. Alternatively, we can build a remote development team together. I can also handle the technical onboarding. You won't believe how quickly you can have a
              perfectly onboarded, integrated team in your ranks to drive your digitalization forward.
